h1. EmailLogger plugin

Email engine for CakeLog, CakePHP 2.x Sends out emails for log entries.
Optional configuration for log levels to send emails, by default to all core log levels.

h2. Background

This plugin was developed when playing with a shared @phpfog CakePHP installation.
No shell and/or file access there. This plugin is just a quick and dirty way check
your app without turning debug on, or check errors that only occur with debug off.

h2. Requirements

* PHP 5.3
* CakePHP 2.x

h2. Installation

_[Manual]_

# Download this: http://github.com/ceeram/EmailLogger/zipball/master
# Unzip that download.
# Copy the resulting folder to app/Plugin
# Rename the folder you just copied to EmailLogger

_[GIT Submodule]_

In your app directory type:
<pre><code>git submodule add git://github.com/ceeram/EmailLogger.git Plugin/EmailLogger
git submodule init
git submodule update
</code></pre>

_[GIT Clone]_

In your plugin directory type
<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/ceeram/EmailLogger.git EmailLogger</code></pre>

h2. Usage

In app/Config/bootstrap.php add: CakePlugin::load('EmailLogger', array('bootstrap' => true));
Add $email_logger configuration in app/Config/email.php or create EmailLogger/Config/config.php

h2. Configuration(optional):

EmailLogger/Config/config.php
Define which levels and email configuration to use for EmailLogger.
Set 'duplicates' to false/true to avoid receiving duplicate emails. (defaults to true)
Without this file, EmailLogger will send out emails for all log entries and all core log levels.

Note: Don't setup your email configuration for EmailLogger with 'log' => true
or any log level which will be handled by EmailLogger

h2. Important

It's not recommended to use this in production.

_Hint:_
Set 'levels' => array('logger') and it wont ever send out emails for core errors,
and add CakeLog::write('logger', 'Log this'); or $this->log('Log this', 'logger');
to the code you want to debug.
